# Tic-tac-toe

**Tic-Tac-Toe (Python CLI Game)**
A Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python for two players, played in the command-line interface (CLI).

**How to Play**
The game is played on a 3x3 board.
Two players take turns, one using X and the other O.
Players enter the row (1-3) and column (1-3) where they want to place their mark.
The game ends when a player wins by aligning three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or if the board is full (resulting in a tie).
**Game Rules**
The board is empty at the start.
Players take turns to input their move.
The game validates the input (ensuring it's within bounds and not already occupied).
The game ends with:
  A win if a player aligns three symbols.
  A tie if all spaces are filled with no winner.
